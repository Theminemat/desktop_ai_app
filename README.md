# Desktop AI Voice App

A simple voice assistant app built with Python using Google’s Gemini API.  
It works like a general smart assistant but with advanced AI and can perform a variety of tasks using AI.
Note: This project was made just for fun to explore the possibilities of AI voice assistants. It’s not meant to be a polished APP, but more of a showcase.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ Voice-controlled AI assistant  
- 🛠️ **Custom Assistant Builder** – Create your own assistants (available via the system tray)  
- ⚙️ **Tray Icon** – Access settings or quit the app from the taskbar  
- 🌐 **(Optional) Web Search & Browser Interaction** – The assistant can open websites or search Google using your default web browser.  
  This feature is optional and can be turned **on or off** in the settings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Get a Free Gemini API Key  
You’ll need a Gemini API key to use the assistant.

### 2. Run the App  
You **must** run `main.py` to start the application.  
Without it, the assistant won’t run and nothing will appear in the system tray.

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Set Your API Key

Once the app is running, click the tray icon in your taskbar to open Settings, and paste your Gemini API key there.
